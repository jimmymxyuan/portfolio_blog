title: 'Urgent Delivery'

This week I helped Marilis preparing for commissioning at a Pactum site around 3 hours away from Melbourne, she has the PLC pre-programmed and ready to be installed on site. We arrived on site with the PLC, only to realise that it has a hardware connection issue when used in conjunction with the site equipment. The only backup PLC we have is in the office inside the testroom, but going back and forward means another day of delay in a already tight schedule. Any delivery service would still be too slow.

Luckily, I was able to get my brother in law to help me, utilizing his resouces in his touring company, he had someone taking the PLC from the office and delivered to site on the same day, saving us the previous commissioning hours. Meanwhile he was able to charge us a whole day at his touring rate in an off-season period, which is a win-win situation. 

Normally this arrangement might trigger a conflict of interest, but it was discussed that in an urgent situation like this, an one off delivery did not cause any rackus in our purchasing department.
