The factory has a series of instruments which measures things such as pressure, height and weight of various tanks into electrical signals as 4 to 20 milliamps. The signal is then plugged into an IR card which is then fed to the PLC. 

Usually the setup of the instrument needs to be done by the instrument itself which could be at various difficult places such as under a big buffer tank or next to a pump or on top of a large tank. However, on the side we are using HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) compatible IO devices which means that tha analog signal of the device are addressed directly to the PLC and allowing the setup of the instrument remotely has saved us a lot of time by going through all devices from the control room and checking up the manual and calculation without actually configuring it inside the factory. 

Although the HART compatible IO Cards cost a lot more than the regular IO Cards, the labour involved with setting up the instrument ended up being a lot less and we configured the instrument a lot faster than usual. So the overall  benefit of using this device out weighs its cost. Also, we can save the configuration of these devices remotely, which means whenever we replace the devices we can automatically reconfigure them using a pre-saved settings, speed up the future maintenance works.
