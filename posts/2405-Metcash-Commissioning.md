I had recently started helping with site commissioning for Metcash project. It was based in Melbourne, so I had to fly there for 2 weeks and make sure all the functional specification points tested inhouse were working and tested on site. Normally this would be a very hard task to finsh in a short time frame for a brand new decently sized site, but since all the features were already tested thoroughly inhouse, it was completely achievable. 


When I arrived at site, I was a little surprised to see that although installations were completely done, there were still a lot of controls problems regarding a few different part of conveyors. Totes would get stuck frequently at corners and interceptions due to mechanical or sensor issues. This made some part of software functional testing quick tricky, as this was not something I have experienced in my emulator environment. I had to help the controls team to move a large number of totes using a different script so that they can identify the issues quickly and resolve them so we can progress as a whole team. 


Once the conveyor issues were resolved, I was able to perform retrieval, decant and picking tests very quickly, as software wise everything was already working, the only difference was that totes were moving a little more erratically on the conveyors than expected, but funtionally they were working as expected. Only minor issues regarding scanners and printers were found on site, mostly due to differences between signals from site equipments than expected inputs. We had to update all the site scanners to include additional input to solve the issues. 


One particular challenge I met on site was that, once the client became familiar with my work, he often requested additional small variations and also asked to provide certain assistance to conduct additional tests for their own need. I had to balance their requests with my workload, if it was small and reasonable I was able to meet it, but often times I had to deny it due to it outside my scope of work and ask it to go through proper channels. The client was not always happy with my response but otherwise I would not be able to finish the commissioning in such a short time frame. 


By the end of the two weeks, I was able to finish most of the functional testing, the only remaining parts were for the dispatch area at the end of the picking lines, as the printers were not completely ready for this task yet. I handed over the task to the local engineers and they will finish testing this to complete the commissioning tasks.
