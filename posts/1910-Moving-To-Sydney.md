I decided to quite my automation engineer job from Tetra Pak and move to Sydney for a change. Although I had lots of interesting experience from the job, I just could not imagine doing it long term constantly being on site while possibly having a family in the future. Plus, I was still more interested in software than hardware, so I ended up joining Dematic as a Software Test Engineer, hoping to ease my way into the IT industry and make my long term career here. 


This was the first time moving to a Sydney where I had no family at all, it was challenging finding the place to rent in such a short amount of time, and moving all of my things all the way from Melbourne all by myself. I planned my trip, stopped at a friend house for a night, and moved straight to my apartment that I signed the lease for the next day. On the same day, I also arranged around 10 pieces of furnitures from IKEA to be delivered and assembled. Luckily I had a few friends to help me with those, as well as getting rid of the remaining cardboard boxes, which sized almost 2 cubic meters. 


I only arranged one week gap between my old job and new job, so I had to do a lot of shopping that week to fill my apartment with all the things I needed, and familiarise myself with nearby shops, and also bought a car to replace my previous company car which I had to return. Funny thing was that I wanted to purchase that company car, but they quoted me a price 10 percent higher than the retail price, despite being 2 years old. I guess it was in demand and they did not want to lose it. All in all I settled quickly and ready to start my new life in Sydney.
