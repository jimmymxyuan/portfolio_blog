Today marks my first day at my second formal job as an Automation Engineer at Tetra Pak. Although I have very little experience in this field, it is actually closely related to my degree of Electrical Engineering.

Not too much techical work on this day as well as the first week, but it was interesting to learn a lot of milk manufacturing technical terms from the various induction material offered at this company. Things like Pasteurisation, UHT (Ultra-high temperature processing) Milk, CIP (Cleaning in place), and separators, bactofuges and a lot of different cheese making processes. Although I doubt I will ever become a milk processing expert, it&apos;s very interesting to learn about these and will be helpful to see things in new perspectives.
