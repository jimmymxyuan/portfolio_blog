This month I had my first solo project - a small bypass line addition to a raw milk production line for disaster recovery purposes. This is a relative simply project, only an addition of a couple of valves, digital signals only, and an upgrade to the PLC software version to match our new standard. 

I have done various preparation in the office, simulated the upgrade in our test room, tested it in the emulation, and familiarised myself with existing site production procedures. However, due to my lack of experience at the time, a few things went wrong.

1. I performed the download at the PLC cabinet directly for its ease of access, however even though we were not at production at the time, there were a lot of condensation at the pipes above, and some water from the pipes dropped down and got into my monitor, causing some damages to the screen. Fortunately the damage is purely vision, did not stop me from finishing the download. 

2. The upgrade to include the new valves was a success, but there are 2 PLCs in this plant, and the first PLC also has to be upgraded to match the second for compatibility purposes. This PLC was old and could not upgrade to the version desired, and keeping it the same version means we had to perform some additional changes in the low level communication modules which I did not know how to do at the point. The site has very bad mobile signals and I had trouble communicating with my boss with the broken voices. In the end he sent me another more experienced colleague to help me with it.

Although the first day was a bit of a disaster, Glenn - who was the most experienced member of the team - came to help me the next day and we completed this mini project successfully at the end. I have learnt a lot from it despite the roadblocks, and looking forward to use this experience to complete more complex projects in the future.
