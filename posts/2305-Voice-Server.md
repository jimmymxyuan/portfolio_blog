As I have worked more and more for Dematic, the more diverse my responsiblities have been. As long as the work was project related, I could be asked to help out, not just limited to testing, as my team consisted of several well experienced people, they all had a wide range of expertise, so I had been expected the same. 


Recently, a new project called ITW required an upgrade to their Voice Server, and I had been asked to set up the new Voice Console Server in our test room, test the migration of the data from the voice profile data in the old server to the new server before applying it to the customer server. I had previously worked a few different projects using the Voice Pick technology, and had been setting up Voice Console Server before, but the new server was a little different. I could not rely on our internal installation instructions, as it was based on the old server, I had instead read up the vendor manual and make sure we cover the differences before installing. 


Once the server was installed, I had to coordinate with the IT team to configure the firewall appropriately so we can connect to it using the office WIFI. I also had to coordinate with our service team to borrow some new Voice Devices to test out the connection to the new server. Finally, once it was confirmed working, I needed to use the data migration functionalities in both server to export the voice profile from one server, then import it into another. This process in theory was straight forward, but still took a few tries due to the format of the data being slightly different, and needed some manual configuration to get it working. 


Now that the new server had been tested and data migration working, I translated my notes on the process into a proper list of instructions and passed it to the service team, who would coordinate with the customer to perform the upgrade and the data migration. I would cross my fingers hoping that everything goes well and I do not get a phone call in the middle of the night informing me something went wrong.
