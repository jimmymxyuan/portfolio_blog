Soon after the 130 million dollar cheese plant was finally fully operational, the client was already thinking about expanding its capacities. Currently the cheese plant had the ability to either produce Cheddar or Mozzerella, but cannot do both at the same time. The customer wanted a second line so that that final cheese processing area can handle both Cheddar and Mozzerella producing all at once, potentially doubling the output at half the cost. 


This was where the Project Modena started, we were asked to build a second line containing milk reception, milk pasteuration, cheese vats and a cheddarmaster, while sharing the other cheese procesing area with the existing plant. It would be built in the old bulk chemical supply area, replacing it, and shifting that area to somewhere else. 


Although this would be the biggest upgrade project we ever work on, it would be much easier compare to the Project Venice, as we could now copy many implementation from the existing cheese plant and apply the learnings from previous project to this one. It would be fully implemented by the Australia team rather than a combined effort of NZ and AU team. We would take this project from the initial design stage all the way to the commissioning and handover stage. I would personally be designing and implementing a large portion of the plant with another Senior Automation Engineer. It was a challenging project for me, but very existing one nevertheless. 


The actual PLC code would be written by a sub-contractor called Macro, in collaboration with our process engineers, but I would be designing the overall network architecture, IO list, PLC panels, and the distribution of all the instruments and devices throughout the plant.
It was a very interesting experience seeing my design being handled over to our automation and electrical contractors, then flying/driving over to oversee the actual PLC/IO Panels, making sure they are correct. And also visiting the Macro Office in NZ to run through a FAT as a client, before implementing it to site together later on. 


When it was finally time to start commissioning, I had to schedule the controls engineers from macro to site, communicate with the site IT person and oversee the connection between our equipment with the site network. My previous work of setting up the instruments was handed over to our new inhouse recruit instead. I worked more as a automation project manager rather than an engineer for this project, performing daily sign in for the contractors, and collaborating with various contractors together to make sure our team had what they needed. In terms of actual engineering work, I probably spent more time revising and maintaining the IO list more than anything else, as during commissioning, many things had to change due to physical limitations. One particular valuable thing I learnt was that, updating the list and updating everyone frequently might make certain group of people happy, but would create more work for everyone else. It would have been more efficient to reduce the amount of updates I did but with more changes instead. 


Although I did very little coding in this project, it was the most fulfilling project I had working for Tetra Pak. Seeing my automation design from start to finish, taking charge of it all the way was a lot of work but very satisfying.
