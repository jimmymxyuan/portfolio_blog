I had been sent to help out with Project Venice, a massive 100+ million cheese plant project that put all the other projects I have been involved with to shame. It was being handled by our New Zealand branch as they have more resources to handle a project this big. 

The project was to build a brand new modern cheese factory from the remnant of previously burmt down old factory in Stanhope due to an fire accident. It included milk reception, milk pasteuration, milk UHT (Ultra-High Temperature processing), cheese vats, cheese blockformers, cheese rapid coolers, cheese packing and whey processing sections. Each section are scaled large enough to be its own plant. When fully built, it will produce 45000 tonnes of cheese every year. 

There were so many contractors on site that they built a small village to house them as temporary offices with 7~8 building total, including multiple offices, a kitchen, shower and even a dedicated satilite internet connection. We had a daily stand up meeting with the head of all the different contractor groups and it filled a whole room every time. 

I was still too junior to manage the contractors at the time, so the team leaders had me assisting other engineers to setup various instruments such as flow meters, pressure meters, variable speed drives and height sensors. For the projects I worked with, this was usually done in a day, but for this project each section of the plant had enough instruments to take several days to setup, enough to keep me busy for months. 

Although my role was pretty small, I had a great time learning working with a large team, dealing with various electrical, mechanical and automation contractors, as well as communicating with all of our engineers as well as our clients in order to deliver this massive project on time. We had a lot of different challenges, but managed to overcome all through effective communication, smart problem solving, and teamwork.
