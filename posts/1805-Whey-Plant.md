It had been several months working at the Stanhope Cheese factory, the project had gone through several stages, from loud construction to wet water flushing, and finally to product trial. During the product trial stage, the process engineers would monitor each batch of products carefully while teaching and telling the operators how each part of cheese project needs to be operated as. 

There was not too much for me to do at the cheese plant at this stage, as all the instruments were working fine, and automation are mostly working correctly as well, so I came to the Whey plant to help out, where the filtering process still need some work. 

The original cheese plant before being burnt down was at the current whey plant, this means some equipments are reused, such as the bulk chemical plant. Reusing of the old equipments proved to be quite a challenge, they were not as well documented and could also be hard to track down. I had to climb up and down a few different places just to reach some problematic instruments to reconfigure them. The IO cards that controlled them also did not always work as they had a slightly different interface, so we had to find the ones that did work and replace them accordingly. 

Once all the equipments were configured and tested, the actual whey making process were much more straight forward than the cheese plant. Basically it involves the use of 2 RO (Reverse Osmosis) plant where the whey output from the cheese plant goes a series of filters in high pressure, to capture as much solids as possible while filtering out the salt, which can then be dried and powdered in a separate plant. 

It was very satisfying to see every bit of the milk being utilized once both Cheese and Whey plant were fully operational.
