title: 'First time Commissioning at a Dairy Plant'

I have started shadowing one of my senior colleagues - Glenn, to assist where I can but mostly to learn what he&apos;s doing commissioning at a Dairy Plant called Natures Dairy Australia. This is my first time doing commissioning work, and it&apos;s been quite eye opening. Various problems will arise on site that I never expected to occur in office. Things like:

- Limited internet due to weak signals
- Limited phone signals
- High noise in various parts of the plant still in construction
- Lack of access to the Plant Network due to switches installation not complete

To overcome these issues, we had to prepare various equipments and PPE, and use temporary local wifi network for both plant and internet access. Our access routers are carefully labelled and distributed to not confuse with existing networks. 

On site, I also learnt basics of PLCs, analog and digital signals feeding the IO cards connected to the PLC, as well as output signals from PLC to various equipments like valves, pumps and conveyors. I am aware of some control  from my studies, but only ever applied in limited environments, it&apos;s interesting to see the real world applications.
