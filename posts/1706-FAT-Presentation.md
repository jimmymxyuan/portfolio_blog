Factory Acceptance Test, otherwise known as "FAT", is a test presented to the customer after an automation design is complete and tested in house and ready to be deployed to site. 

For the previously mentioned Pactum Ambient Drinking Yoghurt, I helped my senior colleague Marilis to develop an automation solution for this project together, and was also able to download and test this solution on a actual PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) as well as connected to a touch screen with SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) setup that will be installed to site later. 

During FAT, we invited the customer over to our test room, and demonstrated how the SCADA interacts with PLC which ultimately complete batch of orders for the yoghurt factory. The functionality list is very long, but in summary, it comes down to the ability to select a list of recipes, receive milk, process them, produce batches of yoghurt at the end, and closing the shift with cleaning in place (CIP) procedures. 

This particular FAT was very successful, and the customer was happy with our presentation, some requests were made at some specific interactions, but overall it has exceeded their expectation. The project was ready to be commissioned on site.
