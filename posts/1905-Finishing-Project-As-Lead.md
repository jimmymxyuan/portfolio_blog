Near the end of Modena Project for the Cheese Plant upgrade, the other senion automation engineer left the company, leaving me in charge of the whole plant for automation commissioning work as Automation Lead. It was intimidating at first, leading the automation team for a 60 million dollar project, but I quickly adjusted to the mind set since I was so familiar with the plant already, and just kept on doing what I was doing while attending more meetings with the customer and project managers. 


One challenging aspect of being an automation lead was that, I had to answer directly to our own management team regarding the project progress and the plant performance. Although the plant started running very quickly after the initial trial period, it took a long time to reach the desired performance from the contract. A lot of unexpected constraints showed up when running both Cheddar and Mozzerella plant together, such as chemical supply and cleaning facilities. We had to perform a lot of optimization with both the old and new plant in order to achieve the rate. Being the automation lead, I also cannot concentrate on the engineering work to make these things happen, I had to attend various meetings both internally and to the customer explaining the issues and showing them the solutions. 


Another interesting aspect of being in charge was that I had to communiate with the client IT team directly in order to provide the necessary network requirement for my team. Normally this would not be any issues, but this particular site had a mix up of old and new IT infrastructure, which ended up causing a lot of delays on providing what we needed to complete the project. The client IT lead was very experienced and open for changes but not very reachable. The site IT contact however was the exact opposite, he was very old fashioned, dislike changes, and always bothering my team asking why we are making certain changes requiring work from site. It always took a lot of convincing to get what we need. 


Overall it was challenging finishing up the project as automation lead, but we managed to deliver the project in the end, meeting all the requirements with a slight delay. I was lucky that our site manager and project manager were very understanding and insightful of the project, they assisted in every step, both in providing the necessary resources and coordinating with the site to provide us the engineers what we need to complete the project.
