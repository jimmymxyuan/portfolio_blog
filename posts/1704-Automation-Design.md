I have started helping Glenn on a new project called Pactum Ambient Drinking Yoghurt. Previously I have only ever jumped in with other projects half way through, so helping with this project gives me an insight of the entire process of working on a project, at least from an automation engineer&apos;s point of view.

We start by analysing the project as whole, estimating how much work is involved, by going through a general macro view of the portion of the plant involved for the project. 

Then we look at the P&ID (Piping and Instrumention Diagram) drawing, and calculate the number of Input Output devices required to automate each devices, including all the valves, pumps, instruments, conveyors and switches, so that we can design the PLC IO cards needed to control all of them, as well as deciding where to put each Carbinates, so that we can cover all the devices while minimizing wiring cost. 

Once the previous part is complete, we can design each cabinet to decide how to wire each components, and design rest of the automation system.
