Most instructions are from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ci-cd-pipeline-for-nextjs-app-with-aws/

### Server setup ###
1. Install node.js by running following commands
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g pm2

2. Copy repo:
git clone https://github.com/jimmymxyuan/portfolio_blog.git
cd portfolio_blog
npm install next
npm run build

3. Redirect port 80 to port 3000 to avoid having to use sudo everytime to host port 80
sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3000

4. Run the server perpetually
pm2 start npm --name portfolio_blog -- start
pm2 save
pm2 resurrect

Note
The pm2 resurrect will rerun the app perpetually even after restart
Only run this after you setup the auto-deploy in AWS

5. Install CodeDeploy (See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-ubuntu.html for more info)
a. On the server, do the following
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full
sudo apt install wget
cd /home/ubuntu
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto
systemctl status codedeploy-agent
b. On the AWS console, do the following
Create an IAM role for AWS Service CodeDeploy
Create an IAM role for EC2 and CodeDeploy
Attach IAM role for EC2 to the EC2
Restart instance
Go to CodeDeploy and Create an application as EC2/On-premises
Create deployment group, with the AWS Service Codedeploy IAM role
Create Pipe Line, with connection setup to Github


### AWS Setup ###
1. Add inbounb rule for HTTP, HTTPS and Custom TCP of 3000
